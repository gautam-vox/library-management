# library-management
A Library Management program made as a school project with the combined power of Python and MySQL. Collaborated with RR for the project.

## about.
This project was made with a good fellow of mine, as part of a school project. Many changes have been implemented by me to the original piece of code for optimization. The overall program is still the same.

## features.
Uses Python for the simple terminal interface and for handling the MySQL database. Can add or remove several books, and can update any book details, all like you would with a typical MySQL prompts but easier. Can also manage any issued books in the same manner.
